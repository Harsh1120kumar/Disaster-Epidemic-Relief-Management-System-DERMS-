a full-stack web application to assist citizens, NGOs, and administrators during disasters and epidemics.

Disaster & Epidemic Relief Management System (DERMS) is a full-stack web application designed to assist citizens, NGOs, and government agencies during natural disasters and epidemic outbreaks. The platform enables citizens to lodge complaints or request aid with real-time geolocation, photos, and issue categorization. An NGO/Volunteer dashboard helps monitor cases, manage resources, and prioritize requests. The Admin/Govt panel provides real-time maps, heatmaps of complaint density, resource analytics, and weather alerts for decision-making.

To enhance usability, the platform integrates an AI-powered chatbot for survival guidance, an AI complaint prioritization system, and real-time weather and disaster alerts. The application is built with role-based authentication (JWT) and features a polished, responsive UI using Tailwind/Material-UI. It is cloud-deployed and seeded with sample data for demonstration.
